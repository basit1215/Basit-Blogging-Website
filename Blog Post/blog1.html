                    process.

            <p class="card-text"><b>Example 1:</b> <i>In my previous role as a marketing analyst, I set a goal to
                    increase our campaign’s
                    engagement by 25% within six months. I achieved this by implementing a new data-driven strategy,
                    constantly
                    testing and adjusting our approach. The campaign ultimately saw a 30% increase in engagement.</i>
